Project: Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired

The aim is to create a better and smarter cane to provide more functions and stregthen the safety of this tool.

Gen-AI tool - ChatGPT

This tool is used during our development of this project, mainly to aid us in explicitly explaining novel/unfamiliar concepts and other components usage/set-up that are not covered in our curriculum. We hereby confirm that we did not use it for the purpose and intention to replace our effort or cut corner, but rather to make the proccess smoother and guide us through all difficulties that might take hours of research and trials-and-errors. Some small parts of the code are written entirely by the tool. However, other code sections and the overall structures are still designed and written by us. In this case, Gen-AI is used to further confirm, validate, and suggest improvement. The choices to whether ignore, accept or modify the suggestive codes are entirely responsible by us in regard to our curriculum's lecture + labs and our project's scope. 

Throughout the files, comments are also made to explain the specific tasks and how Gen-AI assists in that respective section.
